# ARRAY - ROTATION

The following question asks to rotate the integers in a array or lists to k steps and display the output...

In the first 4 lines of code ,we input and display the original array and the number of steps it should 
be rotated...
in the 5th line of code we determine the length of the array..
in the 6th line its given "k=k%n" it is given so as to get the number of steps in a situation where k>n,
the number of steps in such a situation will actually be the remainder of k and n.

nums[:]=nums[k:]+nums[:k] -> this step rotates our array to k steps...
it changes the list in such a way that k elements from the beginning are rotated and put in the end

finally the rotated array is printed
