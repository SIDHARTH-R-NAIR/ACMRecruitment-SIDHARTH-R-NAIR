ITERATIVE METHOD
         
In this method the string is reversed using a loop...
after entering the string, an iterating variable accesses the indices of the string in the reverse order
each letter corresponding to its index is printed and concatenated to another empty string which becomes
our reversed output string.


RECURSIVE METHOD

In this method the string is reversed using a function which calls itself again and again...
each call takes the string without its first letter and reverses it and adds the first letter at the end...
this process is repeated until only one letter is left and then the reversed string is formed back step by
step.
