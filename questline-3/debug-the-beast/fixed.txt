In the second line of code changed '-9999999' to float('-inf') to avoid any user input smaller than
'-9999999'

changed line 18 completely
gave functon call before print statement so as to add the following blocks of code:

an if block which:
prints 'not enough elements' if the user enters less than 2 numbers 

an elif block which:
checks if the user has entered the correct number of elements as specified in 'n'...
if the user has not entered the correct number of elements, then it will give a message instead of output.

and an else block which will give the correct output if the user enters the correct number of elements
and has entered more than 2 elements

changed the 9th line of code to:
elif num>second and num!=largest:
this was done so as to avoid the case where repeated values are entered and now:
it returns float('-inf') as output 

added another elif block in last blocks of codes describing what to print if the output is float('-inf')
