let us call each person 1,2,7,10 based on the time they take to cross (in minutes)

step-1. 1 and 2 crosses together...(time taken to cross = 2 minutes)

step-2. 1 brings the torch back...(time taken = 1 minute)

step-3. 7 and 10 crosses together...(time taken to cross = 10 minutes)

step-4. 2 brings the torch back...(time taken = 2 minutes)

step-5. 1 and 2 crosses together...(time taken = 2 minutes)

total time taken = 2+1+10+2+2 = 17 minutes

LOGIC

The two faster people should travel back and forth to save time

the two slower ones should be sent together
(if they are sent separately then the torch has to come back twice wasting even more time)
