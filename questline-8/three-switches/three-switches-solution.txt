Enter into the room with the three switches

Turn ON the first switch and stay in that room for 5 to 10 minutes...
This will heat the BULB if it is connected to the first switch

Now Turn OFF the first switch and Turn On the second switch, keep the third switch untouched
After you Turned ON the second switch, quickly enter the room with the bulb...

if u find that the BULB is actually glowing and is ON , then it is connected to the SECOND SWITCH.

if the BULB is OFF but it is still warm when u touch it, then it is connected to the FIRST SWITCH.
(since we left the first switch turned on for a couple of minutes, the BULB became warm)

if the BULB is OFF and also cold when u touch it, then it is connected to the THIRD SWITCH.
(since the switch was never touched, no change in bulb can be observed)
