# SUDOKU EXPLANATION

In the question it is said that a number can only appear once in a row, a column and a 2x2 box...
the 2x2 boxes are:
 |-------|-------|
 | box 1 | box 2 |
 |-------|-------|
 | box 3 | box 4 |
 |-------|-------|

 LET US CALL THE ROWS AND COLUMNS AS 'rx' AND 'cx'... where is the corresponding number of row or column

 From the grid it is clear that '3' has appeared in r1-c3,r2-c2, and r3-c1...
 so the only position left for '3' is r4-d4 ...

'1' has appeared in r2-c4 and r4-c2 and since it hasn't appeared in r1 and r3 ... the only position left
for '1' is r1-c1 and r3-c3...

now '4' is entered in r1-c4, so it can only be entered in r2-c1 so as to fill '4' in box-1 once...
since '4' has been entered in both r1-c4 and r2-c1 ... the only positions left for '4' in r3 and r4 are
r3-c2 and r4-c3...

now '2' can be filled in the remaining grids and will still satisfy the criterias in the question...

so the final result looks like:
1 2 3 4 
4 3 2 1
3 4 1 2 
2 1 4 3

"INTERCHANGING THE POSITIONS OF 2 AND 4 WOULD STILL GIVE A CORRECT RESULT"
